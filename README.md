<!-- Issues to resolve -->
Category filter is not working completely.
What is working :
    If the product of selected category is available on page 1, then the products for that category are fetched successfully.
What is not working :
    If the product of a selected category is not available on page one but is available in the api, on selecting that particular category the products are not fetched.
What more to add :
    If the category is de-selected/removed. All the products of all categories must be available on the UI.
